### Overview

WELCOME TO FOOD-HUNTER! 

An app that makes it fun to decide where to eat out ;)

Why would you need Food-Hunter?
One of the benefits that comes from this app is that you are able to spend more quality time with your "squad".

What is Food-Hunter?
Well have you ever been out with the squad and can't agree on a place to eat at. Food-Hunter is a game that helps you decide what restaurant the squad and you should go to. You just enter how many people are in your group, a group name, email, and zipcode. Then each person will select what cuisine they would like, what mood they are currently in like sleepy or hangry, and lastly how much they are willing to spend. We will store the input and out will come a restaurant that your group and you have selected. We take the pain out of decision making in a large group! 

We encourage you to check it out and at the end we will email you to send us a review on the app or restaurant! 
Have fun and enjoy Food-Hunter! 


In this project we have developed an application using technologies such as Express, mySql, Node.js and we have incorporated a new library for sending emails called Nodemailer, Our team will design and build the app using the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API.
